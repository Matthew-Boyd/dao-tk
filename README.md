# Design, Analysis, and Optimizatoin Toolkit (DAO-Tk)

This project develops a toolkit for the design, analysis, and optimization of concentrating solar power 
(CSP) systems, including optimization of both physical design variables and operations and maintenance 
(O&M) activity. The software is derived and actively developed under funding from the U.S. Department of 
Energy -- Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy grant DE-EE000030338 ("Concurrent optimization of capital 
cost and expected O&M").

This work is the result of a collaboration between researchers and industry, including: 
* National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Prime awardee, Dr. Mike Wagner lead) 
* Colorado School of Mines, Prof. Alexandra Newman 
* Northwestern University, Prof. David Morton 
* Argonne National Laboratory, Dr. Sven Leyffer 
* SolarReserve(TM), Charles Diep and Jolyon Dent
